    Hi I am Tushar Anekar learning java script.
    I am planning to code daily so that it becomes a habit.
    I have 5 years of testing experience in salesforce classic and lightning.

    Currently i am learning braching in git and practising the same as well.

    My hobbies are listining to music and watching web series/movies.
    I also love to watch sports like football and cricket.
